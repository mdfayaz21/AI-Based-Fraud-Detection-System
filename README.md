Explanation of the Code
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is standardized using StandardScaler.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to handle the imbalanced dataset.

Model Training:

A Random Forest Classifier is used for training.

Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using a Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve.

Download the Dataset:

Download the dataset from Kaggle.

Save it as creditcard.csv in the same folder as your Python script.

Open VS Code:
